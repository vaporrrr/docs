# Creating an OBJ

The first step of making a render is creating an OBJ file from your world or schematic. The OBJ file will later be imported into Blender. There are two software options for creating an OBJ, Mineways and jMc2Obj. Neither support cubic chunks worlds. If you have a cubic chunks world you'll need to make a schematic or convert to a vanilla world with the Cubic Chunks Converter.
- Use Mineways If These Apply
  * You have a schematic or vanilla world(jMc2Obj doesn't support schematics)
  * You want a simple, small render (<500 x 500 blocks)
  * You don't care that banners and heads won't transfer properly, banners turn white and all heads turn into pumpkins
```eval_rst
.. note::
   Mineways is much less optimized than jMc2Obj, so that is why I don't recommend Mineways for huge areas.
```
- Use Mineways If These Apply
  * You want to render a large area (>500 x 500 blocks)
  * You want banners and custom heads to transfer (Coppertine made a custoom build)
```eval_rst
.. note::
   With jMc2Obj you can render huge areas (I once did all of downtown Seattle and more) when optmize mesh is checked, however it has its drawbacks. When it is checked, blocks like panes and walls may become 2D planes. If you uncheck optimize mesh, performance goes down drastically.
